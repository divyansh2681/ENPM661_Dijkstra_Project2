Project 2 - ENPM 661 - Planning for Autonomous Robots

Name: Divyansh Agrawal 

Goal: Implementing Dijkstra Algorithm for a Point Robot

Work: In this project, the Dijkstra algorithm has been implemented for a point robot. A map of dimensions 400 * 250 is given which has multiple obstacles in it. The user has to input the initial node [x,y] and the goal node [x,y] and then the algorithm solves for the path. The program is a bit slow, reaching from [0,0] to [399,249] might take more than 30 minutes. I am trying to optimize the code and will update the GitHub as soon as I am done. The file can be opened in any python editor and then run.

For any questions regarding the implementation or running of the program, please contact dagrawa1@umd.edu.
